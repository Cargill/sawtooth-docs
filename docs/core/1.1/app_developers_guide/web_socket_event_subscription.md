# About Web Sockets and Event Subscriptions

Applications can subscribe to events by using a web socket connection to
the REST API, but there are several limitations:

-   Only Sawtooth block-commit and state-delta events are supported.
-   You cannot specify a single event type or use filters to fine-tune
    the results. A web socket subscription returns all events.
-   Event catch-up is not available.

We recommend using ZMQ for event subscription, as described in
`zmq_event_subscription`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

For information on using web sockets, see
`../rest_api/state_delta_websockets`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
