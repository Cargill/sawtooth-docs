# Running Sawtooth as a Service

When installing Sawtooth using apt-get, *systemd* units are added for
the following components. These can then be started, stopped, and
restarted using the *systemctl* command:

-   validator
-   transaction processors
-   rest_api

To learn more about *systemd* and the *systemctl* command, check out

To view the console output that you would see if you ran the components
manually, run the following command:

``` console
$ sudo journalctl -f \
    -u sawtooth-validator \
    -u sawtooth-settings-tp \
    -u sawtooth-poet-validator-registry-tp \
    -u sawtooth-rest-api
```

## Validator Start-up Process

# Create Genesis Block

The first validator created in a new network must load a genesis block
on creation to enable other validators to join the network. Prior to
starting the first validator, run the following commands to generate a
genesis block that the first validator can load:

``` console
$ sawtooth keygen --key-dir ~/sawtooth
$ sawset genesis --key ~/sawtooth.priv
$ sawadm genesis config-genesis.batch
```

# Running Sawtooth

Before starting the `validator` component you may need to generate the
validator keypairs using the following command:

``` console
$ sudo sawadm keygen
```

To start a component using *systemd*, run the following command where
[COMPONENT]{.title-ref} is one of:

> -   validator
> -   rest-api
> -   intkey-tp-python
> -   settings-tp
> -   xo-tp-python

``` console
$ sudo systemctl start sawtooth-COMPONENT
```

To see the status of a component run:

``` console
$ sudo systemctl status sawtooth-COMPONENT
```

Likewise, to stop a component run:

``` console
$ sudo systemctl stop sawtooth-COMPONENT
```
