# Transaction Family Specifications

Sawtooth includes several transaction families as examples for
developing your own transaction family. These transaction families are
available in the `sawtooth-core` repository unless noted below.

-   The
    `/transaction_family_specifications/blockinfo_transaction_family`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} provides a way to store information about a configurable
    number of historic blocks. The family name is `block_info`. The
    transaction processor is `block-info-tp`.

-   The
    `/transaction_family_specifications/identity_transaction_family`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} is an extensible role- and policy-based system for
    defining permissions in a way that can be used by other Sawtooth
    components. The family name is `sawtooth_identity`; the associated
    transaction processor is `identity-tp` (see
    `/cli/identity-tp`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}).

-   The
    `/transaction_family_specifications/integerkey_transaction_family`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} (also called \"intkey\") simply sets, increments, and
    decrements the value of entries stored in a state dictionary. The
    `intkey command </cli/intkey>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} command
    provides an example CLI client.

    intkey is available in several languages, including Go, Java, and
    JavaScript (Node.js); see the `sawtooth-sdk-{language}` repositories
    under `examples`.

    The family name is `intkey`. The transaction processor is
    `intkey-tp-{language}`.

-   The `PoET Validator Registry transaction
    family </transaction_family_specifications/validator_registry_transaction_family>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} provides a way to add new validators to the network. It
    is used by the PoET consensus algorithm implementation to keep track
    of other validators.

    This transaction family is in the
    [sawtooth-poet](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-poet)
    repository.

    The family name is `sawtooth_validator_registry`. The transaction
    processor is `poet-validator-registry-tp`.

-   The
    `/transaction_family_specifications/settings_transaction_family`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} provides a methodology for storing on-chain
    configuration settings. The
    `sawset command </cli/sawset>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
    provides an example CLI client.

    The family name is `sawtooth_settings`. The transaction processor is
    `/cli/settings-tp`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

    Note
    :::

    In a production environment, you should always run a transaction
    processor that supports the Settings transaction family.

-   The
    `/transaction_family_specifications/smallbank_transaction_family`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} provides a cross-platform workload for comparing the
    performance of blockchain systems. The family name is `smallbank`.
    The transaction processor is `smallbank-tp-{language}`.

-   The
    `/transaction_family_specifications/xo_transaction_family`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} allows two users to play a simple game of tic-tac-toe
    (see
    `/app_developers_guide/intro_xo_transaction_family`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}). The `xo command </cli/xo>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"} provides an example CLI client.

    XO is available in several languages. The various implementations
    can be found in the `sawtooth-sdk-{language}` repositories under
    `examples`.

    The family name is `xo`. The transaction processor is
    `xo-tp-{language}`.

The following transaction families run on top of the Sawtooth platform:

-   [Sawtooth Sabre Transaction
    Family](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/sabre/releases/latest/):
    Implements on-chain smart contracts that are executed in a
    WebAssembly (WASM) virtual machine. This transaction family is in
    the [sawtooth-sabre](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sabre)
    repository.
-   [Sawtooth Seth Transaction
    Family](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/nightly/master/):
    Supports running Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contracts on
    Sawtooth. This transaction family is in the
    [sawtooth-seth](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth)
    repository.
