title: Development Without an SDK
---

Hyperledger Sawtooth provides SDKs in a variety of languages to handle a
great deal of complexity and simplify developing applications for this
platform. The recommended way to work with Sawtooth is through
`one of these SDKs <using_the_sdks>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
However, if there is no SDK for your language of choice, if the SDK is
missing functionality, or if you want a deeper understanding of what is
going on underneath the hood, use this guide to learn how to develop a
Sawtooth application without the help of an SDK.

This guide uses Python 3 for the code examples, because Python 3
provides a concrete demonstration in a common, readable language. The
information in these examples applies to almost any language. Note that
actual Python development should typically use the
`Python SDK <python_sdk>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.
